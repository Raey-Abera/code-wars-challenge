//Write a function that takes an integer as input, 
//and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. 
//You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

//Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case


let countBits = function(n) {
  // Program Me
  let x= n.toString(2)// base two returned
  let counter= 0;
  for (i =0; i < x.length; i++){ //iterating through the array to find the length
    if (x[i] === '1'){ // comparing the value of sub i to the sting passed through
      counter++ // incrementing
    }
  }
  return counter;
